# Color Catcher Game 🎨🎮

## Project Description
Color Catcher is a dynamic and engaging web-based game where players aim to click on randomly appearing objects that match a target color. The game tests players' reflexes and color recognition skills while providing an interactive and fun gaming experience.

Players can gain points for correct clicks, lose points for incorrect clicks, and face a "Game Over" if they exceed the allowed number of wrong clicks. The game includes sound effects, a restart feature, and a visually appealing user interface.
